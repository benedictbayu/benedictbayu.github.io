# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  This page contains the results of my data analysis on the FIFA 19 dataset. As a football fan, 
  it would be a pleasure to be able to analyze data from the FIFA 19 game. 
  I also made a Machine Learning model to predict the Overall of the footballers in FIFA 19 based on the 
  features contained in this FIFA 19 dataset.
